          Hi! My name is Aditya, and I'm currently trying to get on my way to becoming an ethical hacker of some sort. <br>
          <strong>But why?</strong> <br><br>

          
          To understand that, we need to step back in time. <br>
          
          Let's go back to 8th grade science class, that magical time when the classwork wasn't actually hard (just somewhat time consuming) and I spent my spare time pushing the limits of Android's freedom instead of doing my homework. <br><br>
          
          I remember this day pretty clearly—the bell had just rang, the teacher wasn't here, and she didn't have any work assigned. As you could imagine, nobody really did anything; some were talking to each other, some were playing Fortnite on their school laptops, and some were playing cricket in the back with crumpled tape and a tube of wrapping paper. They kinda sucked, but that's besides the point—it was funny.
          Meanwhile, I had just recently discovered Termux, the Linux terminal for Android. I'd installed a Kali Linux chroot environment in Termux on my Samsung Galaxy A12, and I was trying to install gobuster. The end goal was to (somehow) do a HackTheBox room entirely on my phone in that 45 minutes. <br><br>
          
          Spoiler: it took me about that long just to figure out what gobuster was actually supposed to do. This was before the days where I could ask ChatGPT or Claude about what the heck 'subdomain enumeration' meant, so I was kind of on my own with that one. <br><br>

          From that day on, I spent the greater half of Q4 in 8th grade doing random easy HTB boxes, purely because it made me feel really cool—I was actually hacking stuff, and I actually understood a lot of what I was doing. When other kids asked me what I was wasting my time on, I could tell them that I was quite literally hacking some machine on the internet because I was bored. <br><br>
          
          It was around that time that I decided that security was actually pretty dang interesting, and perhaps something worth pursuing. <br>
          Although the start of the high school workload ate most of my time and I wasn't messing around on HTB at all anymore, there was always that sense of intrigue surrounding the fact that I could literally get paid to be a hacker—legally too—and even learn most of what I needed with sheer will and the vast internet. <br><br>

          And so it began.
