          Hi! My name is Aditya, and I'm currently trying to get on my way to becoming an ethical hacker of some sort. <br><br>
          <strong>But why?</strong> <br><br>

          
          To understand that, we need to step back in time. <br><br>
          
          Let's go back to 8th grade science class, that magical time when the classwork wasn't actually hard (just somewhat time consuming) and I spent my spare time pushing the limits of Android's freedom instead of doing my homework. <br><br>
          
          I remember this day pretty clearly—the bell had just rang, the teacher wasn't here, and she didn't have any work assigned. As you could imagine, nobody really did anything; some were talking to each other, some were playing Fortnite on their crappy school laptops, and there was a group playing cricket in the back. In classic middle school fashion, they were playing with a crumpled ball of tape and a tube of wrapping paper. They kinda sucked, but that's besides the point. <br><br>
          
          Meanwhile, I had recently discovered Termux, the Linux terminal for Android. I'd installed a Kali Linux chroot environment in Termux on my Samsung Galaxy A12, and I was trying to install gobuster. The end goal was to (somehow) do a HackTheBox room entirely on my phone, all in that 45 minute period. <br><br>
          
          Spoiler: it took me about that long just to figure out what gobuster actually was. This was before the days where I could ask ChatGPT or Claude what 'DNS enumeration' meant, so I was kind of on my own with that one. <br><br>

          From that day on, I spent the greater half of Q4 in 8th grade doing random easy HTB boxes, purely because it made me feel really cool—I was actually hacking stuff, and I actually understood a lot of what I was doing. When other kids asked me what I was wasting my time with, I could tell them that I was literally hacking some machine on the internet because I was bored. <br><br>
          
          It was around that time that I decided that security was actually pretty darn interesting, and perhaps something worth pursuing. <br><br>
          
          Although the start of the high school workload ate most of my time and I wasn't messing around on HTB at all anymore, there was always that sense of intrigue surrounding the fact that I could literally get paid to be a hacker—legally too—and even learn most of what I needed with sheer will and the vast internet. <br><br>

          And so it began.
        </p>
      </section><br>

      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2 class="sectheading"></h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Let's be real: I'm nowhere close to being any sort of elite hacker.</strong> At least not yet. <br><br><br>

          
          Here's where I actually stand:<br><br>

          From 7th grade throughout the first half of high school, I've been big on web design—everything HTML, CSS, and NodeJS. For example, in 2020 during lockdown, when school was virtual, we felt like email wasn't cutting it anymore. So, naturally, as the kid who was 'good at computers,' I tried to see what I could do myself to remedy that. <br><br>

          Initially, I tried self-hosting a <a href="https://rocket.chat">Rocket.chat</a> server on an Oracle Cloud instance, but it ended up being more complicated than my 7th grade self initially thought. Instead, I found a tutorial series on YouTube about how to build a simple (wildly insecure, by the way) chatroom in PHP. With the help of a free web host, that was the simple app that we used to communicate during classes. <br><br>

          For my very first web app, it of course wasn't pretty—the 'database' was a <code>.txt</code> file and I thought security was optional—but over the course of that year, I fleshed it out, added multiple text rooms, notifications, a <i>real</i> database, and even a WebRTC voice/video chat app that I 'borrowed' from someone on GitHub and personalized. <br><br>

          From there, my interest in web apps only grew. I've participated in 3-4 hackathons since then, including NCSSM's Smathhacks, and the Congressional App Challenge, and each time, a significant portion of our project has been a full-stack web app that I've built.

          <br><br><br><br>
          
          When high school started, we were told about an opportunity to take classes at a local community college, Wake Tech, which was connected to the full UNC system of colleges. We were told that most if not all credits that we earned at Wake Tech would be transferrable to any UNC college that we could choose to attend. <br><br>

          I didn't look into it during my freshman year, because the majority of the people I heard about that were taking part in the program were all either taking courses like 'Art Appreciation,' or some sort of advanced English classes, which I later learned was purely a way for them to boost their GPAs. <br><br>
          
          While it wasn't at all a bad idea, I in no way wanted to subject myself to more social studies classes, so I assumed that the program was largely useless to me.<br><br>
          
          The next year, however, I learned that pretty much all of Wake Tech's CTE pathways actually <i>were</i> accessible to me, and that I'd been kind of an idiot to ignore that in the fine print. That year, my sophomore year, I took my first networking class, the end result of which was the <strong>Cisco Certified Support Technician in Networking</strong> certification. <br><br>
          
          At that point, having a <i>real</i> entry level certification under my belt, I'd made my first step towards my security side-quest. By that point I knew that networks couldn't exist without security, and vice versa. I decided to take the next step over summer, when I took 2 more Wake Tech classes—Operating System Concepts (NOS-110) and Security Concepts (SEC-110). I figured that since my knowledge at the time was so scattered, I may as well clear up the fundamentals that I probably skipped. <br><br>

          In SEC-110, our textbook was modeled around the CompTIA Security+ exam, and that was where I gained the first bit of actual, practical cybersecurity knowledge that I have at this point in time. <br><br>

          <strong>So that brings us to today.</strong><br><br>

          At this point, I'm comfortable with code, I understand how applications work, I've built a fair few myself, and I have the network and security knowledge of an entry-level support tech. Given a task, access to Google, and enough time, I can work my way through a broad range of problems now. <br><br>

          When it comes to real penetration testing though, those 6 or 7 HTB boxes from 8th grade are the extent of my experience. I'm at the awkward teenage-like stage where I'm not a complete beginner who needs to learn what nmap does or what enumeration is, but I'm also nowhere near the stage where I can just look at the results of that nmap scan and know <i>exactly</i> where to go next. <br><br>

          Given that I'm a high school junior, I'd say I'm pretty competent, but in the reference frame of an actual professional, my capabilities are that of a toddler. I've heard about XYZ security concepts, but I haven't worked with them to actually think like an attacker yet. <br><br>

          That's the gap I'm going to try to bridge in these next few months, and I want to immortalize the whole process right here in this blog.
        </p>

      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2 class="sectheading"></h2>
        
        <p>
          Every time I revisit this field of offensive security, I run into the same problem: <strong>most resources that I come across assume that I'm either brand new or already intermediate</strong>. <br><br>

          It's either been "What is Linux?" videos, or proper writeups that assume I'm fluent in hacker. Evidently, there's a lot in between. I think I've just needed a structured path from where I am now to where I aim to be, rather than trying to reinvent that structure myself. <br><br><br>

          Here's the plan: <br><br>

          For the next couple of months, I'll be working through structured learning platforms, like TryHackMe's offensive security paths, HTB Academy, and real boxes from various sources like VulnHub and PicoCTF. The goal isn't to complete challenges just to complete challenges; the goal is to understand the methodology behind each and every step. Why this tool? Why this approach? What was I missing that I should try on the next one? <br><br>

          The list goes on. Every box I work through, I'll write it up here. Not just "here's how I rooted this one," but more importantly "here's what I tried that didn't work," and "here's what I learned; here's what clicked." <br><br>

          Once I've gotten comfortable with the fundamentals, I'll pick a security domain that excites me the most, whether it be web app security, Active Directory, network pentesting, etc. After the fundamentals, the goal is to become genuinely competent in a specific area. Ideally, by then, I'd have figured out my own methodology and have completed 10+ in that domain. <br><br>

          Then, once I've gotten a good handle on that, I'll work on essentially a 'capstone' project—something that proves I can do real work. The plan is to find 3-4 open-source projects that I can audit and professionally document. It would be something that I'm proud to show people, something that demonstrates that I didn't just follow tutorials. Something that shows that I can apply what I'd have learned to create something valuable. <br><br>

          And of course, each one I work through will (with the developers' permission) end up here on this blog as well.
        </p>

      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2 class="sectheading"></h2>
        
        <p>
          So, there we have it. <br><br>
          
          Starting January, I'll hit the ground running with TryHackMe's Jr. Penetration Tester pathway, which seems to be just the level that I need—past the most basic of the basics, and a good fit to launch me into the intermediate stage. <br><br>

          My goal for the first month is to complete at least 4 boxes and 4 of the 8 modules in the TryHackMe course, building the habit and rhythm to keep me going. <br><br>

          As I said, I'll be documenting everything, publishing detailed writeups for each box I complete as I go. I have a couple good reasons for that: <br><br>

          First, making this public means that now, I <i>have</i> to keep going with this. If I ghost this blog after 2 posts and everybody knows, that's embarrassing. Essentially, I'm betting on my ego to keep me consistent. <br><br>

          Second, it reinforces my understanding pretty significantly. The fact stands that if I can't explain or reteach something, I haven't learned it well enough. If I can't explain why something worked in a writeup, I don't actually understand it yet. Thus, by explaining everything thoroughly, I'll ensure that I actually understand all of what I'm doing. <br><br>

          Third, it builds a portfolio. By the time I'm applying to colleges, and eventually jobs, I won't just have a resume line that says "Interested in offensive security." Instead, I'll have months of documented proof showing exactly what I can do and how I got there. <br><br>

          Beyond that, it's just cool. Becoming a hacker is something that I'm geninely passionate about, and I have a feeling it would be awesome to look back on this in the future. Plus, maybe it helps someone else in the same boat as me—gives them ideas for their own. <br><br>

          So, if you want to follow along, bookmark this site. I'll be posting frequently, whether it be writeups, lessons learned, character development, and probably some failures along the way. <br><br>

          Let's see where I can get in 8 months. <br><br><br>
